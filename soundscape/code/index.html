<p class="extrafirst"> This project is about the perception of sound. We all experience moments in different ways, due to personal taste, past events, and cultural background. To test people's different interpretations I created an anonymous survey, where people could describe a certain experience as a sound, or to be more precise: If you could give ONE moment a sound, what would it be? After collecting all these different sound descriptions, Joost Jacobs, bass player and student at conservatory Haarlem and I discussed some concepts about repetition and layering, and based on that he made some different piano compositions. Another musician Stijn Wylp also helped produce some sounds and collect sounds from his archive.</p>
<br>
<p class="extrasecond"> INSTRUCTIONS: <br> 1. start by hovering ove the boxes and looking at the descriptions. Then drag the boxes (the sounds) from the upper left corner preferably down, so you can separate the sounds. <br> 2. After that, you can pause all the sounds by pressing the spacebar. <br> 3. If you have all the sounds in place and you think fit the described moment the best. <br> 4. Hover over the boxes with your mouse, creating a soundscape you like the most. <br> 5. If you want you can start recording by pressing R. <br> 6. If interested, you can send the audio files to my email address:<a href="mailto:myrthe.schol@gmail.com" target="_blank">myrthe.schol@gmail.com </a></p>
